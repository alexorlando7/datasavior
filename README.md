# Refyne – AI Data Normalization Demo

Refyne is a prototype platform that uses AI to clean, normalize, and visualize messy commercial loan data.

This Streamlit app simulates the end-to-end process that Refyne will offer to banks, real estate firms, and other data-heavy industries.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Simulates file uploads (PDFs, Excels, loan notes)
- Displays parsed and aggregated loan data
- Highlights missing fields (e.g. NOI, Cap Rate)
- Fills in missing values using a simulated AI model
- Shows confidence scores and allows user validation
- Previews a Sigma-style dashboard with analytics

## 📂 Files

- `refyne_app.py` — Streamlit app script
- `refyne_demo_data.csv` — Simulated loan data with missing fields

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload these files to a new GitHub repo
2. Deploy the repo on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Set `refyne_app.py` as your main script file

## 👀 Live Demo Preview

- Extract financial data from documents
- Standardize it into clean data tables
- Make it visible via Sigma dashboards
- Use AI to guess and fill missing data
